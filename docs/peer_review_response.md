## Code Review Comments Addressed

# Carlos V
- Make Docs folder and add all team files such as "user_stories.md" to make repo cleaner.

We added this, it does make our repo cleaner.

- Remove commented-out code to make actual code more readable.

We did this even though it was only a few lines.

- Implement a way to see who follows you if you are logged in.

This will possibly come in a future version
