# Code Review Comments Addressed

## Carlos V
#### Make Docs folder and add all team files such as "user_stories.md" to make repo cleaner.
We added this, it does make our repo cleaner.

#### Add more comments to "Auth.py" to make it easier to understand how it works.
Did not deem as necessary, the developers understand this file. The repo is public and we dont want everyone understadning out auth proccess.

#### Add comments to "Creation.py", unsure how it works completely as it is separate from the other api files
Wrote a short class header comment expalining the purpose of the class

#### Remove commented-out code to make actual code more readable.
We did this even though it was only a few lines.

#### In "Auth.py" change /token to /login for simplicity
Did not deem as necessary.

#### In "Auth.py" change /users/create to /create for simplicity
Did not deem as necessary.

#### Maybe change /users/me to /profile just to understand what that function does.
We took this advise but changed it to '/myprofile'

#### Maybe change the naming /posts/create or /comments/create to new or something to differentiate them.

#### Implement a way to view the users on the site and get their user id in order to follow them.
This will possibly come in a future version.

#### Maybe change the wording of /posts to "You must be logged in to view".
Did not deem as necessary.

#### Implement a way to see who follows you if you are logged in.
This will possibly come in a future version.

#### Maybe add an "About" section to a user profile to view their info
This will possibly come in a future version.
